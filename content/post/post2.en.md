I wondered what would happen if the girl from Vermeer's famous painting: “Girl with a Pearl Earring,” was Sethe. Although Vermeer's original painting was a portrait, (painting like photography) changing the subject to Sethe made the painting symbolic. A slave would never have the opportunity to get an earring, let alone a portrait of herself. This paradox was fascinating, inspiring me to draw this painting.
