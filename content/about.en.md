### Motivation

"I thought, this has got to be the least read of all the books I'd written because it is about something that the characters don't want to remember, I don't want to remember, black people don't want to remember, white people don't want to remember. I mean, it's national amnesia."
*-Toni Morrison*

This National Amnesia is at the heart of the American story and how we interpret the events of slavery and the events after is how we represent America. To truly understand America, we must confront its past. All of it.

This website is a collection of the creative response's to Toni Morrison's book Beloved. The website displays another relic of our interpretation of Toni Morrison's work and of America. These are the art that *We can pass on*.

### Other

If you have any questions about the website itself or want to add your own art of any form to it, please feel free to email. This is based off of Toni Morrison's birthname and an email address I own: [chloe.anthony.wofford@gmail.com](chloe.anthony.wofford@gmail.com).
